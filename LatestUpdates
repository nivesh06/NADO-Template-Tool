******Steps to Fix: District Not Available for Resource Escalation*******

1. Select the Correct Region (US or CA).
2. Make sure you're picking the right region from the dropdown.
3. Pick Any Available District. If your actual district is missing, just select any district from the list.
4. Manually replace the District Name in Outlook once you hit the send button.
5. After selecting, edit the district field and type in your correct district name.

*Note: Donâ€™t Worry About PDL.
The system uses the region to route the escalation, so it will still go to the correct District Manager (DM).

Other Updates:
1. For 6HR CTRs, do not set a window longer than 4 hours!
-While we can set longer windows for 4HR Response cases, 6HR CTRs must be set with a 4-hour window due to how SLA is calculated for these entitlements.

2. For resident locations, set Delay Code 8 - Customer Caused Delay
-Update the times as needed and do not leave as Delay Code 0 - Response Met!

3. For NBD Orders, do not provide Hemmersbach the DN or Logistics Tracking #!
-For all NBD orders and any order coming from C299, C208, or C212 we should be waiting for the 1Z tracking number to populate.

4. When working in FSM, please ensure that the Dispatch Aid is reviewed to confirm whether it requires assignment to an HPE AE.
-This verification should be completed before assigning the work to an engineer and prior to submitting a resource escalation!
